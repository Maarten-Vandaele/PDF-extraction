Contain and collect spillage with non- combustible absorbent material such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, clean sand or non-acidic clay and then wet down (dampen) the mixture with water. DO NOT USE peat moss. Sweep or scoop up using non-sparking tools and place into suitable properly labeled containers for prompt disposal. The sweepings should be wetted down further with water. Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains and sewers. Consult a regulatory specialist to determine appropriate state or local reporting requirements, for assistance in waste characterization and/or hazardous waste disposal and other requirements listed in pertinent environmental permits. 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE Handling General information on handling: Contact with materials to avoid or exposure to temperatures exceeding the SADT may result in a self-accelerating decomposition reaction with release of flammable vapors which may autoignite. Keep away from heat, sparks and flames. Avoid contact with the skin, eyes and clothing. Prevent product contamination. Keep container tightly closed and away from combustible materials. Wash thoroughly after handling. Emptied container retains product residue. Observe all labeled safeguards until container is cleaned, reconditioned or destroyed. Do not reuse container as it may retain hazardous product residue. Storage General information on storage conditions: Outside or detached storage is preferred. Store out of direct sunlight in a cool well-ventilated place. Store away from combustibles and materials to avoid. Refer also to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code 432, Code for the Storage of Organic Peroxide Formulations. Storage stability – Remarks: Follow the recommended storage temperatures provided in this Section in order to maintain stability and oxygen content. Storage incompatibility – General: Acids (concentrated solutions) Strong oxidizing agents Reducing agents Amines Accelerators Strong bases Friedel - Crafts reaction catalyst transition metal salts metal ions Temperature tolerance – Do not store below:– 50 °F (10 °C) Temperature tolerance – Do not store above: 100 °F (38 °C) 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION Airborne Exposure Guidelines: Engineering controls: Investigate engineering techniques to reduce exposures below airborne exposure limits or to otherwise reduce exposures. Provide ventilation if necessary to minimize exposures or to control exposure levels to below airborne exposure limits (if applicable see above).If practical, use local mechanical exhaust ventilation at sources of air contamination such as open process equipment. Respiratory protection: Where airborne exposure is likely or airborne exposure limits are exceeded (if applicable, see above), use NIOSH approved respiratory protection equipment appropriate to the material and/or its components (full facepiece recommended). Consult respirator manufacturer to determine appropriate type equipment for a given application. Observe respirator use limitations specified by NIOSH or the manufacturer. For emergency and other conditions where there may be a potential for significant exposure or where exposure limit may be significantly exceeded, use an approved full face positive-pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus or positive-pressure airline with auxiliary self-contained air supply. Respiratory protection programs must comply with 29 CFR § 1910.134. Skin protection: Wear appropriate chemical resistant protective clothing and chemical resistant gloves to prevent skin contact. Consult glove manufacturer to determine appropriate type glove material for given application. Wear face shield and chemical resistant clothing such as a rubber apron when splashing may occur. Rinse immediately if skin is contaminated. Wash contaminated clothing and clean protective equipment before reuse. Wash thoroughly after handling. Eye protection: Use good industrial practice to avoid eye contact. 9. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Color: Colourless to yellow.

STABILITY AND REACTIVITY Stability: This material is chemically unstable and should only be handled under specified conditions. Hazardous reactions: Hazardous polymerization does not occur. Materials to avoid: Acids Amines Oxidizing agents Reducing agents Accelerators Strong bases Friedel - Crafts reaction catalyst metal ions transition metal salts Conditions / hazards to avoid: See HANDLING AND STORAGE section of this MSDS for specified conditions. SADT - Self Accelerating Decomposition Temperature. Lowest temperature at which the tested package size will undergo a self-accelerating decomposition reaction. This reaction will generate flammable vapors which may autoignite. The length of time to generate a decomposition reaction, after the SADT has been reached or exceeded, is dependent upon how much the SADT has been exceeded and the length of time needed for the reaction exotherm (heat spike from increasing decomposition rate) to initiate a rapid decomposition reaction. Typically, SADT is inversely proportional to package size. Larger packages will have a lower SADT due to smaller ratio to heat transfer area to volume of product. Hazardous decomposition products: Temperatures at or above the SADT can result in the release of hazardous decomposition products which are flammable and may autoignite. Thermal decomposition giving flammable and toxic products Carbon oxides 11. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION Data on this material and/or its components are summarized below.

Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. 5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES Suitable extinguishing media: Water fog or fine spray. Dry chemical fire extinguishers. Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers. Foam. Alcohol resistant foams (ATC type) are preferred. General purpose synthetic foams (including AFFF) or protein foams may function, but will be less effective. Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire. Page 3 of 10 Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture Hazardous combustion products: During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition to combustion products of varying composition which may be toxic and/or irritating. Combustion products may include and are not limited to: Carbon monoxide. Carbon dioxide. Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Container may rupture from gas generation in a fire situation. Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids. Advice for firefighters Fire Fighting Procedures: Keep people away. Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry. Use water spray to cool fire exposed containers and fire affected zone until fire is out and danger of reignition has passed. Fight fire from protected location or safe distance. Consider the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Immediately withdraw all personnel from the area in case of rising sound from venting safety device or discoloration of the container. Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire. Move container from fire area if this is possible without hazard. Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to protect personnel and minimize property damage. Special protective equipment for firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, boots, and gloves). If protective equipment is not available or not used, fight fire from a protected location or safe distance. 6.

Component Regulation Type of listing Value/Notation Polyethylene glycol US WEEL TWA aerosol 10 mg/m3 Exposure controls Engineering controls: Use local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below exposure limit requirements or guidelines. If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, general ventilation should be sufficient for most operations. Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations. Individual protection measures Eye/face protection: Use safety glasses (with side shields). Skin protection Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material when prolonged or frequently repeated contact could occur. Examples of preferred glove barrier materials include: Butyl rubber. Natural rubber (\"latex\"). Neoprene. Nitrile/butadiene rubber (\"nitrile\" or \"NBR\"). Polyethylene. Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate (\"EVAL\"). Polyvinyl alcohol (\"PVA\"). Polyvinyl chloride (\"PVC\" or \"vinyl\"). NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove supplier. Other protection: When prolonged or frequently repeated contact could occur, use protective clothing chemically resistant to this material. Selection of specific items such as faceshield, boots, apron, or full-body suit will depend on the task. Respiratory protection: Respiratory protection should be worn when there is a potential to exceed the exposure limit requirements or guidelines. If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, wear respiratory protection when adverse effects, such as respiratory irritation or discomfort have been experienced, or where indicated by your risk assessment process. For most conditions no respiratory protection should be needed; however, if discomfort is experienced, use an approved air-purifying respirator. The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators: Organic vapor cartridge with a particulate pre-filter. 9. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Appearance Physical state Liquid.

LD50, Rabbit, > 20,000 mg/kg Acute inhalation toxicity At room temperature, exposure to vapor is minimal due to low volatility; single exposure is not likely to be hazardous. For respiratory irritation and narcotic effects: No relevant data found. Typical for this family of materials. LC50, Rat, 6 Hour, dust/mist, > 2.5 mg/l No deaths occurred following exposure to a saturated atmosphere. Skin corrosion/irritation Prolonged contact is essentially nonirritating to skin. Serious eye damage/eye irritation May cause slight temporary eye irritation. Corneal injury is unlikely. Sensitization Did not cause allergic skin reactions when tested in humans. For respiratory sensitization: No relevant data found. Specific Target Organ Systemic Toxicity (Single Exposure) Evaluation of available data suggests that this material is not an STOT-SE toxicant. Specific Target Organ Systemic Toxicity (Repeated Exposure) Recent findings of kidney failure and death in burn patients, as well as some studies using animal burn models, suggest that polyethylene glycol may have been a factor. Page 7 of 10 The use of topical applications containing this material may not be appropriate in severely burned patients or individuals with impaired renal function. Based on available data, repeated exposures are not anticipated to cause significant adverse effects. Carcinogenicity Did not cause cancer in laboratory animals. Teratogenicity For similar material(s): Did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals. Reproductive toxicity For similar material(s): In animal studies, did not interfere with reproduction. Mutagenicity In vitro genetic toxicity studies were negative. Animal genetic toxicity studies were negative. Aspiration Hazard Based on physical properties, not likely to be an aspiration hazard.\n",

Dry chemical fire extinguishers. Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers. Foam. Alcohol resistant foams (ATC type) are preferred. General purpose synthetic foams (including AFFF) or protein foams may function, but will be less effective. Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture Hazardous Combustion Products: During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition to combustion products of varying composition which may be toxic and/or irritating. Combustion products may include and are not limited to: Carbon monoxide. Carbon dioxide. Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Container may rupture from gas generation in a fire situation. Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids. Advice for firefighters Fire Fighting Procedures: Keep people away. Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry. Use water spray to cool fire exposed containers and fire affected zone until fire is out and danger of reignition has passed. Fight fire from protected location or safe distance. Consider the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Immediately withdraw all personnel from the area in case of rising sound from venting safety device or discoloration of the container. Burning liquids may be extinguished by dilution with water. Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire. Move container from fire area if this is possible without hazard. Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to protect personnel and minimize property damage. Special Protective Equipment for Firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, boots, and gloves). Avoid contact with this material during fire fighting operations. If contact is likely, change to full chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus. If this is not available, wear full chemical resistant clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus and fight fire from a remote location. For protective equipment in post-fire or non-fire clean-up situations, refer to the relevant sections. 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Page: 2SDS: GYLCOL ETHER DPM Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Isolate area.

EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROECTION EXPOSURE LIMITS COMPONENT LIST TYPE VALUE Dipropylene Glycol OSHA TableZ-1 PEL 600 mg/m3 100 ppm SKIN monomethyl ether ACGIH TWA 100 ppm SKIN ACGIH TWA 150 ppm SKIN A \"skin\" notation following the inhalation exposure guideline refers to the potential for dermal absorption of the material including mucous membranes and the eyes either by contact with vapors or by direct skin contact. It is intended to alert the reader that inhalation may not be the only route of exposure and that measures to minimize dermal exposures should be considered. Personal Protection Eye/Face Protection: Use safety glasses (with side shields). Skin Protection: When prolonged or frequently repeated contact could occur, use protective clothing chemically resistant to this material. Selection of specific items such as faceshield, boots, apron, or full-body suit will depend on the task. Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material when prolonged or frequently repeated contact could occur. Examples of preferred glove barrier materials include: Butyl rubber. Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate (\"EVAL\"). Examples of acceptable glove barrier materials include: Natural rubber (\"latex\"). Neoprene. Nitrile/butadiene rubber (\"nitrile\" or \"NBR\"). Polyvinyl chloride (\"PVC\" or \"vinyl\"). NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove supplier. Respiratory Protection: Respiratory protection should be worn when there is a potential to exceed the exposure limit requirements or guidelines. If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, wear respiratory protection when adverse effects, such as respiratory irritation or discomfort have been experienced, or where indicated by your risk assessment process. For most Page: 3SDS: GYLCOL ETHER DPM conditions no respiratory protection should be needed; however, if discomfort is experienced, use an approved air-purifying respirator. The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators: Organic vapor cartridge. Ingestion: Use good personal hygiene. Do not consume or store food in the work area. Wash hands before smoking or eating. Engineering Controls Ventilation: Use local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below exposure limit requirements or guidelines.

If potential for exposure exists refer to Section 8 for specific personal protective equipment. Inhalation: Move person to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration; if by mouth to mouth use rescuer protection (pocket mask, etc). If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel. Call a physician or transport to a medical facility. Skin Contact: Wash skin with plenty of water. Eye Contact: Flush eyes thoroughly with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses after the initial 1-2 minutes and continue flushing for several additional minutes. If effects occur, consult a physician, preferably an ophthalmologist.

Consider the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Immediately withdraw all personnel from the area in case of rising sound from venting safety device or discoloration of the container. Burning liquids may be extinguished by dilution with water. Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire. Move container from fire area if this is possible without hazard. Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to protect personnel and minimize property damage. Special Protective Equipment for Firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, boots, and gloves). Avoid contact with this material during fire fighting operations. If contact is likely, change to full chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus. If this is not available, wear full chemical resistant clothing with self-contained breathing apparatus and fight fire from a remote location.

There are rare inconclusive reports of human sensitization from skin contact with Isopropyl Alcohol. Repeated and/or prolonged exposure may cause: Defatting of the skin with itching, redness or rash. Fabrics treated with Quilon are not skin sensitizers in humans. Eye contact may cause eye corrosion with corneal or conjunctival ulceration, pain or blurred vision. Exposure to the product mists or vapors may cause irritation of the skin and eyes. Inhalation may cause irritation of the respiratory tract with coughing and discomfort; or temporary central nervous system depression with anesthetic effects such as dizziness, headache, confusion, incoordination, drowsiness, and loss of consciousness. Ingestion may cause irritation of the digestive tract with stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; or temporary central nervous system depression; however there may be no symptoms at all. Inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact to isopropyl alcohol may cause nonspecific effects such as headache, nausea and weakness, flushing of the face, or low blood pressure.

Exposure controls/personal protection Ingredient name Exposure limits Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists, gases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: safety glasses with side- shields. If operating conditions cause high dust concentrations to be produced, use dust goggles. Eye/face protection : Environmental exposure controls : Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels. Appropriate engineering controls : Use only with adequate ventilation. If user operations generate dust, fumes, gas, vapor or mist, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas, vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment. Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location.

Exposure controls/personal protection Hand protection Use a properly fitted, particulate filter respirator complying with an approved standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Respirator selection must be based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe working limits of the selected respirator. Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties.

Due to many conditions (e.g. temperature) it must be considered, that the practical usage of a chemical-protective glove in practice may be much shorter than the permeation time determined through testing. Manufacturer's directions for use should be observed because of great diversity of types. Eye protection: Safety glasses with side-shields (frame goggles) (e.g. EN 166) Body protection: Body protection must be chosen depending on activity and possible exposure, e.g. apron, protecting boots, chemical-protection suit (according to EN 14605 in case of splashes or EN ISO 13982 in case of dust). General safety and hygiene measures Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice.
